\begin{minted}[frame=single]{matlab}
% Generate x- and y-nodes
x=linspace(0,1); y=linspace(0,1);

% Calculate z=f(x,y)
for i=1:length(x)
 for j=1:length(y)
  z(i,j)=x(i)+2*y(j);

\subsection{Other alternatives to the Theory chapter}
Sometimes, it is more appropriate to name this chapter Background.

At CSE, there exists a large span of different types of thesis works. Sometimes it is more appropriate to join the Theory and Methods chapters, sometimes the Theory chapter would be so small that it should be a subsection. Talk to your supervisor to find the most appropriate structure for your thesis.
