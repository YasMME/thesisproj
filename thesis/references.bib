                    predictions from two recurrent neural network classifiers, a speaker and a
                    listener, unified by a recursive pragmatic reasoning framework. Experiments show
                    that this combined pragmatic model interprets color descriptions more accurately
                    than the classifiers from which it is built, and that much of this improvement
                    results from combining the speaker and listener perspectives. We observe that
                    pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must
                    distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the
                    target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of human
                    utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic
                    behaviors. We also show that the embedded speaker model reproduces many of these

abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that has received increasing attention from both the computer vision and the natural language processing communities. Given an image and a question in natural language, it requires reasoning over visual elements of the image and general knowledge to infer the correct answer. In the first part of this survey, we examine the state of the art by comparing modern approaches to the problem. We classify methods by their mechanism to connect the visual and textual modalities. In particular, we examine the common approach of combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks to map images and questions to a common feature space. We also discuss memory-augmented and modular architectures that interface with structured knowledge bases. In the second part of this survey, we review the datasets available for training and evaluating VQA systems. The various datatsets contain questions at different levels of complexity, which require different capabilities and types of reasoning. We examine in depth the question/answer pairs from the Visual Genome project, and evaluate the relevance of the structured annotations of images with scene graphs for VQA. Finally, we discuss promising future directions for the field, in particular the connection to structured knowledge bases and the use of natural language processing models.}

abstract = {Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.},
