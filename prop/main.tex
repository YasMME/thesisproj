\section{Introduction}
Robots have the potential to be useful in many fields–they can perform tasks
that are dangerous for humans, as well as tasks that are simply tedious. These
robots are often operated based on pre-defined actions, or remotely. The potential increases in efficiency from being able to give a goal/task in natural language and have the robot interpret and determine how to carry out this task are huge.
This would make robots more accessible generally, since it would reduce the
learning curve for operating them. A patient in a hospital would likely find it much easier to simply tell the robot 'I need water', rather than having to find the 'water' option on some sort of touchscreen interface. It also would support situations where the instructions being given are too complex for this kind of interface--one example of this is human-robot teaming, in which groups of humans and robots cooperate to achieve tasks in situations such as disaster scenarios\cite{Kruijff-Korbayova:2015aa}. Communication in natural language can facilitate organisation where all of the humans are working with all of the robots, rather than an individual human having control over one or many robots. Situations like this require complex understanding of natural language instructions. 

% SD 2020-12-11 21:10:09 +0100: There may be cases where even more complex understanding of the natural language instructions is required which would be very complex for the person so "describe" using touch screen interface. For example, human-robot teaming: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13218-015-0352-5 \cite{Kruijff-Korbayova:2015aa} and There is a lot of research in this area how robots and humans could work together, see for example the references to this paper I found https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00288.pdf

\section{Context}
\subsection{Navigation}
Navigation is a common task for robots, a subset of instruction following; applications for robots include moving through a space recording or streaming video back to a human and collecting objects in a space to deliver to someone in a different space. The task can be split into two main challenges: self-localization and mapping\cite{Wallgrun:2007zr}. 

\subsection{Grounding}
A key challenge in creating robots that can interact with humans in natural language is grounding--connecting an external object to a word or phrase. This challenge also includes linking of actions to words. For example, what does 'turn' mean? Grounding is a challenge in a variety of tasks, such as image captioning, where models need to produce labels for both the objects in the image, and the objects' interactions with each other in natural language\cite{karpathy2014captioning}.

% SD 2020-12-11 21:25:12 +0100: Actually, the notion of grounding language in perception has been explored in robotics first and then moved into image captioning which is a much younger task: https://canvas.gu.se/courses/36167/assignments/75554 and https://canvas.gu.se/courses/36167/assignments/76897

Image captioning is a fairly new task, but grounding in the field of robotics has been an area of active research for a long time. In 2002, Lauria et al. presented a project in which a robot was given natural language instructions, which were mapped to procedures of identified primitives, such as 'turn'\cite{lauria2002}. More recently, Hermann et al. presented a simulated embodied agent learning grounded language through a combination of unsupervised and reinforcement learning, with minimal prior knowledge\cite{hermann2017grounded}. Another approach with minimal prior knowledge was presented by Thomason et al., where the robot learns through dialogue with a human\cite{thomason2019grounded}.

% SD 2020-12-11 21:37:27 +0100: Here you could expand that there is active research on how humans navigate and reason in space. Perhaps a paper by Diedrich Wolter: https://www.sfbtr8.spatial-cognition.de/project/r3/material/QSR_Challenges.pdf \cite{Wallgrun:2007zr}

%\subsubsection{Dialogue}
%Navigation based on dialogue is a current area of active research--datasets for a dialogue based navigation tasks are often collected as human-human dialogues, which are then used to train agents in replay or supervised learning scenarios. 
%
%Cooperative Vision-and-Dialog Navigation is a dataset of over 2000 navigation dialogues\cite{thomason2019visionanddialog}. It was collected via Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing; pairs used the Matterport3D simulator and a chat interface, with one person, the ’oracle’, able to see the ideal moves for the navigation task, giving natural language instructions to the other person, the ’navigator'. The navigator could ask clarifying questions. The oracle was also shown the navigator's current visual frame. 
%
%A similar but smaller dataset is RobotSlang, consisting of 169 dialogues between a commander referencing a static map and a human driver only able to see the camera view of the robot they were controlling\cite{robotslang}. The commander relayed instructions to the driver, based on their understanding of where the robot was. The driver was able to ask clarifying questions, such as where exactly to turn, and the commander could periodically ask localization questions, such as what color wall the driver could see.
%
%There has also been a lot of research on how humans actually communicate about directions. Humans have a number of strategies for communicating about routes, and which strategy someone will choose to use is often not immediately obvious\cite{Tenbrink:2010qf}. They may also choose to use multiple methods in conjunction. These strategies can relate to what perspective directions are given from or how much detail to give initially, among other things. Another point of consideration is how humans automatically adjust their strategies when interacting with a computer. Tenbrink et al. found that people gave generally sparser commands when interacting with a computer system than they did interacting with another human, even when not given instructions to do so\cite{Tenbrink:2010qf}. 
% SD 2020-12-11 21:42:35 +0100: Similarly, a lot of research has been done on the language side and dialogue. How humans generate descriptions in conversation that are understandable by conversational partners? What landmarks will they use? How will they structure the route description: it is unlikely that they will give a complex description (as you would get from Google straight away). The description will be dependent on who the conversational partner is and what task they are involved in which further complicated computational modelling on the natural language processing side. Perhaps, \cite{Tenbrink:2010qf,Fellner:2017aa,Janarthanam:2012aa}

\subsection{Visual Question Answering}
Visual Question Answering is a task in which an agent must answer a question--these questions are "free-form and open-ended"\cite{vqa_2015}. This task differs from image captioning in that answering these questions requires specific information. There is a huge variety in possible question types in this task, including object detection ("how many...?"), activity recognition ("Is this person doing ...?"), and knowledge-base reasoning ("what is ... made of?"). 

\subsection{Embodied Question Answering}
Embodied Question Answering combines the navigation and VQA tasks into one: the embodied agent must navigate to find the object that the question refers to\cite{embodiedqa}. For example, for the question 'What color is the refrigerator?' the agent must identify where the fridge is most likely to be, the kitchen, and navigate there before identifying the fridge and answering the color. This task has been expanded to Multi-Target Embodied Question answering, in which questions can include multiple targets, allowing for comparison questions such as 'is the oven in the kitchen the same color as the sink in the bathroom?'\cite{eqa_multitarget}. Current approaches for this task use templated questions, limiting the question types that can be asked. The EQA dataset includes nine question types: location, color, color\_room, preposition, existence, logical, count, room\_count, and distance, though the EQA-V1 dataset, used for the experiments by Das et.al includes only the first five question types\cite{embodiedqa}. The MT-EQA dataset adds six comparison question types\cite{eqa_multitarget}.


\subsection{Simulation}
Working with embodied agents is resource intensive and makes reproducibility difficult to impossible, so simulation is beneficial for research. Within simulation, environments can be kept consistent, allowing for both reproducibility of an experiment and for comparison of different systems/methods. Simulation also allows for the reuse of datasets of human descriptions, which as discussed above, are time-consuming and expensive to produce.  

AI Habitat is a simulation platform for working with embodied AI\cite{habitat19iccv}. It consists of two parts, Habitat-Sim, the 3D simulator, and Habitat-Lab, the library for embodied AI development. Habitat's current main focus is navigation, mainly through indoor spaces, but there is some ability for object interactions--for example moving a chair from one point to another. Habitat-PyRobot Bridge is a library, written by members of the Habitat team, to support the transfer of a simulated agent in Habitat to a physical robot\cite{Kadian_2020}. 

% SD 2020-12-11 21:35:47 +0100: You could also expand the point about reproducibility earlier that working with simulation environments has benefits for research since different systems can be compared, and datasets of human descriptions (which are expensive to obtain) reused.

\section{Goals and Challenges}
For this project, the overarching question is: how can information learned in other contexts be used to improve performance of an agent in an embodied question answering task? % SD 2020-12-11 22:04:22 +0100: Given this research quetsion it is good that you give more background about the challenges for navigation instructions as I commeneted above.

Since EQA consists of multiple, modular, tasks, it seems like a good candidate for transfer learning. For the task of identifying where to go to find an object, humans use a lot of information that they've learned from other contexts, such as, what room people typically use an item in. Identification of colors can also be learned in non-embodied context, so that would be another place for pre-training to give the agent prior knowledge. 

In Das et. al, they report the agent entering the target room 65\% of the time when the agent is spawned 10 actions away from the target, and 52\% when the agent is spawned 50 actions away\cite{embodiedqa}. This shows a place for improvement. These numbers could mean either that the navigator is in itself only partially successful, or that the agent is having difficulty determining which rooms to check when given questions that do not include the room, or a combination of both of those things. The goal is to determine how pre-training could improve this performance. \todo{Stopping Criteria}

%Also, datasets for dialogue navigation take a long time to collect, since humans are generating the descriptions in real time, and humans are not necessarily very efficient. For an unsupervised learning approach, several thousand route instructions would be needed. % SD 2020-12-11 21:58:38 +0100: The bottle-neck is mainly due to human descriptions. These take time and several thousand route instructions would be required for an unsupervised approach.
%Because of this, many navigation datasets are small, which limits the agent's knowledge, so being able to use disparate datasets would be beneficial. For example, maybe an agent could learn colors and positions from a dialogue about items on a table, and then would be able to apply that knowledge from the beginning when presented with dialogue navigating through a house. An agent could be trained on a corpora of dialogue from a different domain, and from this learn about human interaction strategies. The system could then be fine tuned on dialogue from the navigation domain, and adapt the knowledge about interaction to understanding route instructions. 

% SD 2020-12-11 22:06:15 +0100: We could train the system on corpora of dialogue from a different domain and then fine tune it on this domain. This way the system would already know something about the interaction strategies of humans; the leanring would then be adapting this knowledge to the route instruction scenario.

%Another use for transfer learning is in the fact that a goal within this research is for these human-human dialogues to become human-robot dialogues, more flexible than those described in \cite{thomason2019grounded}. \todo{add mention of EQA templating approach} Transfer learning could aid in teaching the robot grammar and vocabulary, rather than limiting its knowledge of language to the navigation dialogue, making it easier to create a robot that could generate its own responses to instructions. 

\section{Approach}
I plan to use Habitat to simulate my navigation agents and environment, and use the EQA baseline available in habitat-lab as a starting point. The baseline consists of a feature extraction CNN, a VQA model, and a Navigation model (which consists of a planner and a controller), all of which can be trained independently. (Since it is modular, sections could also be replaced.) Task and scene datasets for Matterport3D are also available. \footnote{Code for generating EQA-v1 questions is also available, but designed for use with SUNCG, which is no longer supported, and so would require modification to be useable\cite{embodiedqa}.} I will need to identify potential datasets for background/external knowledge such as navigation datasets in other scenarios (outside, for example) or static VQA datasets. 

Next would be to train the habitat-baseline EQA. Next would be to pre-train the VQA and navigation modules on other datasets, and compare to the baseline. Modification to individual modules might be required to allow pre-training on data from different contexts. 

Overall performance can be calculated as simple accuracy with regards to the ground-truth answers, since the question answering model is classification across 172 answers. However, since the EQA model actually consists of 3 separate models, they can also be evaluated separately. For navigation, Das et. al identify a number of evaluation metrics. For distance they used the final distance to the target, the change in distance to the target over the episode, and the minimum distance to the target at any point in the episode. They also identified the percentage of questions where the agent ended in the room containing the target, the percentage in which the agent entered the room with the target at any point during the episode, and the percentage of episodes in which the agent stopped to answer the question before the maximum number of actions was reached. 

%datasets of learning information like position in non-navigation scenarios ('what is to the left of the blue ball in this picture?', for example), or general natural language dialogues.

%and the Cooperative Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation set as the main dataset for training and testing of the agents. 

%I will also need to determine what models have been used for navigation agents, and what kinds of representations those models learn and use. These representations will affect what kinds of background knowledge could help the model--a mainly word based representation might benefit from pre-training with general natural language dialogues, a mainly visual one probably wouldn't.

%Next would be to build and train a model for object navigation solely on the Cooperative Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation dataset, to compare with models incorporating background information. After this, I would need to build and train models incorporating background information, and compare them. 

%Generated descriptions can be evaluated based on automatic metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr, as well as via crowdsourcing on platforms such as Mechanical Turk. The performance of the agents at the navigation task can be expressed as the number of steps the agent took over the shortest path (of course multiplied by if the robot ever found the object). 

% SD 2020-12-11 22:08:22 +0100: Looks good! Good luck!
